# Traceback-most-recent-call-last-Error-microsoft-point-autofarmer
Hello, I'm not really familiar with coding and such, but i've been trying to set up a microsoft point autofarmer, and it keeps stopping at the part where it tells me how many points I hve. I don't really know what to about this, and I'm very frustrated. If anyone can see this please me.
